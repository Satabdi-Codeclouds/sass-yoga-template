# Yoga Template
## SASS

This portfolio has a consistent and unified design with a consistent look and feel across all pages. With Tailwind's pre-defined color schemes, typography, and spacing, I have created a cohesive design without worrying about the inconsistencies that may arise when styling from scratch.

Yoga Website Template is a modern, responsive, and fully customizable design tailored for yoga instructors, studios, or wellness centers. Built with SASS (SCSS), the template provides a clean codebase and modular structure, making it easy to scale and maintain.

Designed with serenity and user experience in mind, it blends soft color schemes, elegant typography, and smooth animations to create a peaceful and professional online presence.
